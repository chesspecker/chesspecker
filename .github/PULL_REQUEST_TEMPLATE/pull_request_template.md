## Checklist

### Before opening a new PR

- [ ] Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate
- [ ] You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the fix/ or feature/ prefixes. Good examples are: fix/signin-issue or feature/issue-templates
- [ ] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line)
- [ ] You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit)
- [ ] Make sure the linting passes by running `yarn lint`

### Make a good PR

- [ ] Your pull request MUST NOT target the `main` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `dev` instead
- [ ] Give a descriptive title to your PR
- [ ] Provide a description of your changes
- [ ] Put `closes #number` or `fixes #number` in your comment to auto-close the related issue
